package org.apache.flink.streaming.api.functions.sink.filesystem;

/**
 * Wrapper class for part files in the {@link org.apache.flink.connector.delta.sink.DeltaSink}.
 * Part files are files that are currently "opened" for writing new data.
 * Similar behaviour might be observed in the {@link org.apache.flink.connector.file.sink.FileSink}
 * however as opposite to the FileSink, in DeltaSink we need to keep the name of the file
 * attached to the opened file in order to be further able to transform
 * {@link DeltaInProgressPart} instance into {@link DeltaPendingFile} instance and finally to commit
 * the written file to the {@link io.delta.standalone.DeltaLog} during global commit phase.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, we need a custom implementation of {@link DeltaBulkPartWriter} as a workaround
 * for getting actual file size (what is currently not possible for bulk formats when operating
 * on an interface level of {@link PartFileInfo}, see {@link DeltaBulkPartWriter} for details).
 *
 * @param <IN> The type of input elements.
